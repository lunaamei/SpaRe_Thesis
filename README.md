Title:

Fixation-Related Potentials Corresponding to Spatial Decision-Making During Free Exploration in Virtual Reality


Abstract:

Successful spatial navigation requires making informed decisions at navigational decision points. Thus, studying when and how these decisions are formed contributes to the general understanding of human spatial cognition. The current research combines Electroencephalography (EEG) and Virtual Reality (VR) technology in an experiment assessing spatial knowledge acquisition during free exploration of a large-scale city-like environment. In a free exploration paradigm, such as employed in our research, it is unclear when participants are engaging in cognitive decision-making. In my thesis, I apply a graph- theoretical approach to track participants’ path choices in VR. Furthermore, I compute fixation-related potentials (FRP) to assess brain activity related to participants’ eye movements while they explore the virtual scene. Specifically, I assess the FRPs at decision points and non-decision points, where decision points are defined in 3 different ways. The results indicate that the way decision points are defined influences the resulting FRP waveforms, thus highlighting the importance of how experimental conditions are set. Moreover, this thesis demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of combined EEG and eye-tracking experiments for studying dynamical cognitive processes during navigation in VR. The reported work may be useful for future research investigating spatial decision- making during free exploration in VR.
